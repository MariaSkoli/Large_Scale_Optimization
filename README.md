# Large_Scale_Optimization
### After a natural disaster, relief supplies must be transported to a set of 200 geographically dispersed locations.
* Each of these locations covers different regions, so it has a predetermined product demand.
* To transport goods a set of 26 homogeneous vehicles is used, each with a maximum carrying capacity equal to 3
tn.
* Each vehicle starts its route from a central point 𝑑 = {0} where the products are located. It then visits some of
the 200 service locations.
* All routes are considered to start simultaneously at t=0.
* Every service location is served once by exactly one visit of a single vehicle.
* Vehicles are considered to have a constant speed of 40 km/hr.
* At every service location, an unloading time of 15 minutes is considered. This time is necessary for the unloading
operations.
#### The problem calls for the minimization of the service time completion of the customer to be served last. 
#### In other words,all service locations will obviously have a time when they have received their products (𝑡􀯜 , 𝑖 = 1 … 200). The problem calls for the minimization of the largest 𝑡􀯜 value.
